this compares any 4 countries in real gdp from the date you put into the function. for example if you put in 10 for the amount then it will keep the gdp of all the countries at the rate it was 10 years prior to 2022.
it does this by subtracting the inflation rates each year for all the countries from the gdp figures.
keep all three files in the same directory. it is based on worldbank data up until 2022 and will work with any country, use uppercase for the first letter and some are repeated or abriviated such as "USA"
